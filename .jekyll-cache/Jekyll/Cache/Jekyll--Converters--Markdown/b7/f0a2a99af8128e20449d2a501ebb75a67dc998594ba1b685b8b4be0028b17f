I"<p>I’m adding a blog to my site to encourage myself to dig deeper and more formally into my interests. Currently, I’m an avid journaler. Unfortunately when journaling I fall too often into the traps of messy thoughts and lazy language. I figure that by posting my thoughts publicly–despite my incoming 0 pageviews–I’ll be forced to write things I’m a little more proud of. Which is a really exciting prospect for me.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe if I do something with my life somebody will actually read this.</p>
